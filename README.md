## Introduction

### What is this application ?
This is a python application to load mongodb database data in pyside2 interface

### Requirements
* Python3.6
* pip install pymongo==3.7.2 - MongoDB Python Driver
* MongoDB 4.0.4 - Database Server
* (Optional)MongoDB Compass 1.16.3 - To view database

### What MongoDB Operation covered in this application
1. Connect to MongoDB database
2. Create new database
3. Create new collection
4. Insert new data
5. Update existing data
6. Query Data
7. Remove Data
8. Store image on MongoDb Database


### What is the core logics related to PySide2
1. Create a TableView
2. Create a QAbstractTableModel
3. Load MongoDB Database data in QAbstractTableModel
4. Make QAbstractTableModel rows inline editable to edit database
5. Create (Add Row, Remove Row) context Menu on Tableview
6. Create Dynamic Headers in QAbstractTableModel
7. Add New Empty Row in QAbstractTableModel
8. Remove row from QAbstractTableModel
9. Edit Cell value in QAbstractTableModel


## Informal Code Review

## Artifact(s)
#### Migrating to Pyside And QTable
##### a. Software Design and Engineering
  In this section, I will choose to enhance software design. For the artifact, I will reuse the source code I have created for my last term final project, which crate and modified the built in stock market database by using MongoDB.  However, the last term final project just ends with pure Python code, which has no software design implement. Therefore, I want to create the final program which will enhance on software design and support user interface

## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Working on our search? Be sure to set `debug: true` in `site/assets/js/src/search.js` file.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run `npm install` to install the Node.js dependencies, including Hugo (the site builder).
2. Run `npm run test` (or a specific npm script) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line.
4. Open `http://localhost:9001/` in your browser, and voil√†.

Learn more about using Hugo by reading its [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).
